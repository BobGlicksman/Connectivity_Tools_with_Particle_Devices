# Connectivity_Tools_with_Particle_Devices
Document describing the IoT connectivity tools and techquies that we use with Particle devices.

We (Team Practical Projects) have developed a number of tools and techniques for integrating our
Internet of Things projects with external apps and services.  We use Particle devices (see particle.io)
and cloud-based services that Particle provides to implement various integration scenarios:
## Real-time communication with a mobile app.
We describe how we create mobile apps that communicate with our embedded systems using MIT App Inventor 2
and Particle's cloud API.
## Device logging to a cloud spreadsheet
We describe how we use Particle webhooks and Google Apps Script to log sensor data from our embedded
devices to Google Sheets.
## Real-time alarm/alert notification.
We describe how we use Particle webhooks, Google Apps Script and mobile providers' SMS gateways to
send alarm and alert messages to mobile devices using SMS texting.
## Device-device secure wireless communication.
We describe how we use Particle's publish/subscribe mechanism to securely and wirelessly communicate between
embedded devices.
## Integrating to a cloud database.
We describe how we use Particle webhooks and PHP to provide embedded evices a means to communicate with
cloud-based services that use a REST API, including third party services and our own cloud database.
